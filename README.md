# django-pagination
Django helps you manage paginated data – that is, data that’s split across several pages, with “Previous/Next” links.
All methods of pagination use the Paginator class. It actually splits a QuerySet into Page objects Given list of objects and the number of items you’d like to have on each page to Paginator class,  it gives you methods for accessing the items for each page.
